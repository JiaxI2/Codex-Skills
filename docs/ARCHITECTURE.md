GitHub selects the light or dark SVG through its theme-only fragment markers. Mobile and remote README views reuse this same SVG pair, and each visible Banner links to its original. Both exports come from the canonical [Diagram IR](architecture/codex-skills-architecture.diagram.json); the editable [Visio VSDX](assets/codex-skills-architecture.vsdx) is retained for review.

## Repository Boundaries

`Codex-Skills` is the only source repository for maintained skills, plugin packaging, and Codex lifecycle hook source. `AiCoding` is the platform integration repository and new-machine entry point. It locks `Codex-Skills` through `CodingKit/agents/skills` as a Git submodule and must not copy or manually maintain skill source.

## Source And Generated Boundaries

Manual source:

- `embedded/`
- `platform/`
- `plugins/AiCoding/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `plugins/AiCoding/hooks/`
- `plugins/AiCoding/README.md`
- `config/aicoding-plugin-pack.json`
- `scripts/*.ps1`

Generated output:

- `plugins/AiCoding/skills/`
- `plugins/AiCoding/BUILDINFO.json`

Generated files are created by `scripts/build-plugin.ps1`. They must not be edited manually. The build writes `plugins/AiCoding/skills/.generated` as a local marker.

## External Standalone Skill Bindings

GitHub-sourced standalone Skills are URL-bound instead of copied. The dependency chain is:

```text
AiCoding
-> CodingKit/agents/skills (Codex-Skills submodule)
-> external/<repository> (upstream Skill repository submodule)
-> mapped directory containing SKILL.md
```

`.gitmodules` records the upstream repository URL, while `config/external-skill-bindings.json` records the runtime Skill name, real Skill subdirectory, and `latest-stable-tag` policy. `scripts/manage-external-skills.ps1 -Action Sync` fetches tags, selects the highest non-prerelease SemVer tag, and updates the gitlink only with `-Apply`. The gitlink still pins the selected release commit for reproducible clones. `scripts/verify-skills.ps1` rejects undeclared external directories, anonymous gitlinks, mismatched URLs, non-stable-tag gitlinks, missing mapped `SKILL.md` files, and frontmatter-name drift.

`scripts/manage-external-skills.ps1 -Action Remove -Name <name> -Apply` removes the binding manifest entry, `.gitmodules` section, and gitlink together. AiCoding removes the matching runtime registry entry and only deletes a user-level junction when its target exactly matches the registered source path.

External general-purpose Skills remain standalone and are not added to the AiCoding plugin unless plugin packaging is separately approved. AiCoding may expose them selectively through its standalone Skill profile by mapping the runtime name to the nested source path.

## BUILDINFO Model

`BUILDINFO.json` is intentionally non-self-referential. `sourceCommit` records the input `HEAD` used for the build before the generated `BUILDINFO.json` is committed. `BUILDINFO.json` is excluded from package digests, and `buildInfoModel` records this rule explicitly.

To avoid repeated-build drift, `buildTimestampUtc` uses the input commit time instead of wall-clock time. A repeated build with unchanged inputs must leave `git status` unchanged.

## Plugin Installation And Cache Refresh

Formal installation is through a Codex Marketplace entry, not by manually editing the Codex plugin cache. The development marketplace is `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; the AiCoding platform marketplace lives in `AiCoding/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and points at the submodule package path.

Codex may load plugins from an installed/cache copy. Updating the AiCoding submodule does not automatically refresh an already installed local plugin. The platform update flow must explicitly:

1. update the submodule;
2. verify the packaged plugin;
3. refresh or reinstall the plugin through supported Codex plugin surfaces when available;
4. re-check `/hooks` because changed plugin-bundled hooks require review/trust again.

Scripts must check whether the local Codex CLI supports plugin commands before invoking them. If the CLI is unavailable, scripts report the next manual `/plugins` step instead of editing cache directories directly.

## CodingKit Asset Discovery Protocol

Plugin skills and hooks do not copy `CodingKit/examples`, `CodingKit/modules`, `CodingKit/platforms`, `CodingKit/tests`, or `CodingKit/tools`. External assets are discovered by protocol:

1. prefer `AICODING_HOME` when explicitly set;
2. otherwise walk upward from the active repository `cwd` until `config/codex-kit.json` is found;
3. validate that the manifest contains `codingKitRoot` and that expected asset directories exist;
4. treat missing assets as capability unavailable, not as plugin failure.

AiCoding owns `config/codex-kit.json`. Codex-Skills only documents the protocol and may provide helpers later.

## Hook Boundary

Codex lifecycle hooks are auxiliary workflow constraints. They can remind, block, or route based on local repository state, but they are not a complete security boundary and must not be treated as a replacement for Git hooks, CI, branch protection, code review, or human release approval.

Plugin hooks must:

- use `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` when accessing plugin-local or writable plugin state;
- avoid personal absolute paths;
- fail with clear JSON output;
- avoid modifying business source code;
- remain conservative when input JSON is missing or malformed.

## AiCoding Submodule Rule

AiCoding must not rebuild `plugins/AiCoding` inside `CodingKit/agents/skills`. The correct flow is:

```text
Codex-Skills: edit source -> build plugin -> verify -> commit -> push
AiCoding: update submodule -> verify/install -> commit platform pointer
```

This keeps submodule content reproducible and avoids dirty submodule working trees.
